# PWAANG
Extended version of a Haskell class assignment

## Background
In Spring 2024, in my "Programming Language Concepts" class, we had to make a game called PWAANG (Professor Ward's Amazingly Awesome New Game). The original assignment just required us to satisfy a few test-cases, but I decided to implement the full game after the end of the semester. 

## How to play
Stay tuned...
